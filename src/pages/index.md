    And we wouldn't be fond of blogging but when we do go at it, we go at it
    awful and very hard.

    We'd do about 45 lines in about two hours. We'd have a packet of crips then, and a maybe an auld packet of peanuts.

    And we'd go for probably, we'd write ten more lines anyway. And we'd get up the following morning and Maureen would have the fry on.

    And we'd go at it again.
description: justsendit.ie is a platform for technical blogger who hate doing
  things manually. You'll find a mixture of blogs on random musings, interesting
  experiments with original solutions and reviews and how tos on interesting
  software and technology thats already out in the open. There is no schedule
  for new blog releases but rest assured that when we go at it, we go at it
  awful and very hard

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
